# TODO/BUGS #

  * Store usernames and passwords in gnome-keyring
  * Allow multiple instances of ampache
  * Support playlists

  * Fix genres - shows up as numbers right now
  * Fix date - not implemented in Ampache yet(?)

  * Don't store constants that are not settings in gconf

  * Figured out why "-D ampache" doesn't work if I run rhythmbox from ampache
> > plugin directory

  * Remember View->Browse state (and enable by default?)

  * Try to keep the catalog persistent (add api to ampache to version catalogs?)

  * Figure out why dragging song to local library works but to iPod does not

  * Fix RB sorting to ignore articles (the, a, etc - ampache has a good list)

  * Proxy support (?) - this may be "fixed" by using Loader()
